# Finance & Supply-Chain Analysis
This project involves performing financial and supply chain analytics on Atliq hardwares data. The primary objective is to answer various analytical questions related to sales, gross sales, market, product, customers, and supply chain forecasting.

## Project Overview
In this endeavor, I took a closer look at Atliq Hardware, a fictional leader in computer hardware. The challenge was to empower the management with valuable insights using MySQL.

## Supply-Chain concepts used
- Forecast value: The predicted value of demand for products.
- Net error: The difference between forecast value and actual value.
- Absolute Net error: the positive value of net error even if the net error is negative
- Absolute Net error percent: Total absolute net error divided by total forecast value
- Forecast accuracy percent: 100 â€“ absolute net error percent
